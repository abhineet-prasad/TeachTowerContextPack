=====================================================================================

What does it do?
----------------

The WorldSpawnerLifetimeScope class is a custom module for configuring dependencies. It plays a crucial role in the game's architecture by:

-   Registering the WorldEntitySpawner implementation as a singleton service to the IWorldEntitySpawner interface.
-   Extending a ModuleLifetimeScope and is a part of a system that manages the lifetimes of different modules or services within an application.
-   Utilized by the dependency injection framework VContainer to ensure that services are correctly managed throughout the application lifecycle.

How to work with it?
--------------------

1.  Register IWorldEntitySpawner: So that it can be resolved and used anywhere during the application's lifecycle. This step ensures that the spawner functionality is accessible application-wide, providing a consistent mechanism for entity spawning.
2.  Register other services: You may need to use in the application. This is important for maintaining a clean and manageable dependency injection setup, facilitating the addition of new services or modules as your game expands.

The WorldSpawnerLifetimeScope class exemplifies how to structure and manage dependencies within a Unity project, particularly those using VContainer for dependency injection. It showcases a practical application of dependency management principles, ensuring that key services like entity spawning are efficiently managed and easily accessible across the project.
