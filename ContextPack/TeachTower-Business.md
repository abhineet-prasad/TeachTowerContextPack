## Game Design Framework
- Academic questions are decoupled from gameplay. Nothing in the game world relates to learning yet game content is gated by answering academic questions similar to how other mobile games might require players to watch an ad to access a feature or reward.
- No overarching story progression. NPC interactions and story elements are modular.
- No character level progression. Characters progress by acquiring tools that give them access to new areas of the world or more interesting interactions with existing areas.
- The core game consists of multiple gameplay modules. Each gameplay module is self-contained and can be introduced or removed from the game without complex entanglement from other gameplay modules. Gameplay modules are seasonal in nature to create a sense of urgency.
