### IMainEnvironmentTerrain Interface:

-   Defines a contract for accessing a Unity Terrain object.
-   Meant to standardize how terrain information is accessed across different parts of a game.

### MainEnvironmentTerrain Class:

-   Implements the IMainEnvironmentTerrain interface.
-   Acts as a MonoBehaviour that allows assignment of a Unity Terrain object through the Unity Editor, making the terrain accessible to scripts that require terrain data.

How to work with it?
--------------------

1.  Register IMainEnvironmentTerrain with VContainer's DI framework: This step is crucial for making Unity's Terrain data accessible throughout your game, enabling various game mechanics and features that depend on terrain analysis and manipulation.

2.  Once registered, resolve it anywhere to get access to Unity's Terrain data: By doing this, you can enhance your game's environment interaction, such as spawning entities in specific terrain types or areas.

3.  The WorldEntitySpawner class, for example, requires an IMainEnvironmentTerrain to work with terrain data for spawning entities: This illustrates the importance of having accessible and standardized terrain data within your game's architecture, allowing for more dynamic and interesting gameplay mechanics.

The MainEnvironmentTerrain class and the IMainEnvironmentTerrain interface demonstrate a clear and effective way to integrate Unity's terrain system into your game, ensuring that terrain data is easily accessible and manipulable by various parts of your game logic.
